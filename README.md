Learn React
-----------

This walkthrough of React is a *work in progress*. It currently coveres the first four topics: Basic Components, Props, State and Redux.

It's designed to be a high-level overview, but I hope it's helpful. Here's how to get started.

First, install [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/)
```
sudo npm -g install sails
```

Next, clone the repo
```
git@github.com:ecoker/learn-react.git
```

Jump into the project and install the dependencies:
```
cd learn-react && npm install
```

Working locally, you'll want to check out the different branches. You can go through the much nicer looking `ReadMe` on GitHub, but work the code by checking out branches.

Example:
```
git checkout basic-components
```    

Then use `sails lift` to start your project! And good luck! React is a great framework. I hope this helps you on your journey.
